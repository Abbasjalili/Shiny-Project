Introduction
This independent project, titled 'Statistics Distribution Made by Shiney App in R,' represents a comprehensive exploration into ten unique statistical data distribution models. Developed outside the confines of a formal class setting, this endeavor delves into the intricacies of data distribution—a fundamental concept in statistics. The heart of the project lies in the creation of a Shiny app using R, a dynamic and interactive platform that serves as an effective medium for statistical analysis and visualization. Leveraging the capabilities of Shiny, the app not only introduces ten diverse types of statistical data distribution models but also provides users with an interactive and user-friendly interface. This facilitates a hands-on experience, allowing individuals to explore and comprehend the nuances of each model.In the realm of statistics, understanding data distribution is paramount. It functions as a key determinant of variable values and quantifies relative frequencies, transforming raw data into visually compelling graphs and charts. Such graphical representations play a crucial role in extracting valuable information from the data. Moreover, this project underscores the importance of comprehending the distribution within a population. A thorough understanding of the types of distribution assists in applying appropriate statistical techniques and methods, ensuring robust and accurate analyses. The Shiny app in R enhances this understanding by offering a practical tool for exploring and studying statistical data distribution models. Outlined below are the ten distinct models for data distributions presented in this project. The Shiny app in R serves as an innovative vehicle, combining the power of statistical analysis with user-friendly interactivity to make the exploration of data distribution both engaging and insightful:

1- Bernoulli’s Distribution
2- Binomial Distribution
3- Normal (Gaussian) Distribution
4- Poisson Distribution
5- Exponential Distribution
6- Multinomial Distribution
7- Beta Distribution
8- Beta-binomial distribution
9- T- Distributions
10- Uniform distribution
